    Day 30: top-k retrieval with metadata filters.

    The query is embedded with the SAME model used at ingestion time --
    this has to match, since a query embedded by a different model has no
    meaningful distance to chunks embedded by this one. Filters
    (document_id, source_type) narrow the candidate set BEFORE ranking,
    not after, so top_k results come from the filtered set rather than
    being padded out by irrelevant documents that happened to rank low.

    document_ids (plural) is a Day 32 addition for the evaluation script
    only -- it scopes retrieval to a specific set of documents (the eval
    corpus) so measured results aren't diluted by whatever else happens to
    be sitting in the same database from manual testing. Not exposed on
    the public /retrieve or /ask request schemas; internal use only.

    Returns (Chunk, filename, distance) tuples, sorted by distance
    ascending (closest first).

    Postgres: the distance is computed IN the database via pgvector's
    cosine_distance operator, using the ivfflat index from the Day 29
    migration -- an approximate nearest-neighbor search, not a full scan,
    which is what makes this viable at real corpus sizes.

    SQLite (test suite only): pgvector's comparator has no SQLite
    equivalent, so this path fetches the (small, test-scale) candidate set
    and ranks it in Python. This would not scale to a real corpus -- which
    is exactly why the Postgres path exists and uses an index instead of
    this fallback.
